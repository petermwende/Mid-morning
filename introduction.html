<h4 style="color: green">Ben Carson</h4>
<p>Born in a family of two and of a divorced mother.Forced to go to the library everyday after school
for a recap on previous learning.On one strange day he learned about rocks and collected one which he
showed his teacher during a geography class.Of course no one in his class could expect a dumb person
  like him to have an idea of what that was. Buh he was right actually. Thats how his life transformed
  from a dupe to a cunning mf.</p>
